## Bell's Inequalities 
Deriving Bell's inequalities in Bipartite scenario where both parties have $$\geq 2$$ settings, each having $$\geq 2$$ soutcomes is done by using convex hull computations.
This repository contains the code for generating the aforementioned inequalities in situations where one of the parties have 5 settings and the other party has $$\leq 4$$ 
possible settings
